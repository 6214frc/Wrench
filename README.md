# PHEnix 2019
The robot code of team 6214 in all its C++ glory

## About PHEnix
PHEnix is a rather small team working out of Pender High School in Burgaw NC. We accept members from any School in Pender County however there are independent teams for most Schools currently.

## Building
The project uses a build tool called Gradle to help assemble and deploy the code to the robot. This is, as of 2019, the standard way of working with the robot (according to FRC). If this doesn't mean anything to you don't worry. Its bundled with the code so you don't have to do anything extra.

To get Started:
1. Download this repository using [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
2. Download Visual Studio Code using [the guide found here](https://wpilib.screenstepslive.com/s/currentCS/a/932382-installing-visual-studio-code-c-java)
3. Make sure to install the relevant plugins for Visual Studio (found on the guide)
4. In the Upper Right corner of the screen (provided you have installed all the required plugins) there should be a hexagon shaped icon with a W in it. Click that and select the "Build Robot Code" option (you can search for it by typing that in)

If it fails to build then that likely means that some of the tools and libraries used by this project have not been installed. You can install them by clicking on the Hexagon again and running "Install all tools from GradleRIO"
